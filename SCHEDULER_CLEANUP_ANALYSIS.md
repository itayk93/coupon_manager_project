# 📊 Scheduler Cleanup Analysis Report

**Generated on:** 2025-08-27  
**Purpose:** Analysis of database cleanup opportunities after scheduler removal

---

## 🔍 Executive Summary

After removing the internal scheduler system, several database elements are no longer in active use and can be considered for cleanup. This analysis identifies **1 table** and **3 columns** that are now orphaned.

---

## 🗄️ Tables Analysis

### ❌ **Tables That Can Be Removed**

#### `daily_email_status`
- **Current Status:** Orphaned (only referenced in disabled scheduler files)
- **Structure:**
  - `id` (INTEGER, Primary Key)
  - `date` (DATE)
  - `process` (VARCHAR(50))
  - `was_sent` (BOOLEAN)
- **Current Records:** 707 records
- **Last Activity:** 2025-08-27
- **Usage:** Only used by disabled scheduler files (`scheduler_config.py.disabled`, `scheduler_utils.py.disabled`)
- **Recommendation:** ⚠️ **Can be removed** - No active code references

### ✅ **Tables Still in Use**

All other tables in the database are actively used by the current system:
- `users`, `coupon`, `transactions`, etc. - Core functionality
- `newsletters`, `newsletter_sendings` - Used by new Cron Job email system
- `admin_settings` - Configuration management
- All other tables have active references in the codebase

## 🗂️ Columns Analysis

### ✅ **Columns That Will Be Reused for New Cron Job System**

#### In `coupon` table:
1. **`reminder_sent_30_days`** (Boolean, default=False)
   - **Current Usage:** 4 out of 243 coupons have this set to TRUE
   - **New Purpose:** Track if 30-day expiration reminder was sent via Cron Job
   - **Recommendation:** ✅ **Keep** - Will be used by external Cron Job for reminder tracking

2. **`reminder_sent_7_days`** (Boolean, default=False)
   - **Current Usage:** 0 out of 243 coupons have this set to TRUE
   - **New Purpose:** Track if 7-day expiration reminder was sent via Cron Job
   - **Recommendation:** ✅ **Keep** - Will be used by external Cron Job for reminder tracking

3. **`reminder_sent_1_day`** (Boolean, default=False)
   - **Current Usage:** 0 out of 243 coupons have this set to TRUE  
   - **New Purpose:** Track if 1-day expiration reminder was sent via Cron Job
   - **Recommendation:** ✅ **Keep** - Will be used by external Cron Job for reminder tracking

### ✅ **Columns Still in Use**

#### In `users` table:
- **`dismissed_expiring_alert_at`** - ✅ **Keep** - Still used in `profile_routes.py` for user alert management

## 🧹 Cleanup Recommendations

### 🚨 **Safe to Remove**

1. **Drop table:** `daily_email_status`
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE daily_email_status;
   ```

### 📝 **Migration Script**

```sql
-- Remove only the orphaned table
-- Reminder columns will be reused for new Cron Job system

-- Remove orphaned table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS daily_email_status;
```

### 🔄 **New Cron Job Endpoints**

The reminder columns will be used by new API endpoints:
- `/admin/scheduled-emails/api/cron/send-expiration-reminders` - Send coupon expiration reminders
- `/admin/scheduled-emails/api/cron/send-pending-emails` - Send scheduled newsletters

### 💾 **Storage Impact**

- **`daily_email_status` table:** ~707 records - minimal storage impact
- **Reminder columns:** Will be kept and reused for new functionality
- **Total estimated space savings:** <1MB (from removing daily_email_status table only)

---

## 🔐 **Safety Considerations**

### ✅ **Safe to Remove**
- All identified elements are only referenced in disabled files
- No active application code depends on these database elements
- New Cron Job system operates independently

### 🚨 **Keep These**
- `reminder_sent_30_days`, `reminder_sent_7_days`, `reminder_sent_1_day` in `coupon` table - will be reused for Cron Job
- `dismissed_expiring_alert_at` in `users` table - actively used
- All newsletter-related tables - used by new email system
- All other existing functionality remains intact

---

## 📋 **Implementation Steps**

1. **Backup Database** (recommended before any cleanup)
2. **Run Migration Script** during maintenance window (only removes daily_email_status table)
3. **Create New Cron Job Endpoint** - add expiration reminders API
4. **Keep Model Definitions** - reminder columns will be reused
5. **Test Application** - verify no functionality is affected
6. **Clean Up Disabled Files** - can safely delete `scheduler_*.py.disabled`
7. **Set Up External Cron Jobs** - configure server cron jobs to call new API endpoints

---

## 📈 **Benefits of Cleanup**

- **Simplified Schema:** Remove unused complexity
- **Better Performance:** Slightly reduced table size
- **Cleaner Codebase:** Remove orphaned model fields
- **Maintenance:** Easier database maintenance
- **Documentation:** Clear separation from legacy scheduler system
